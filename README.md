# Graph-Convolutional-Networks-in-insider-threat-detection
In this repository we use the Enron email corpus to try and identify fraudulent employees with the help of graph convolutional networks. To achieve our goal we created 6 scripts.
* **Extracting Email Information**: In this script we extract all information from the emails necessary for our future analysis.
* **Extract fraudulent employee email addresses**: Extraction of the email addresses from the employees prosecuted for fraud.
* **Data Cleaning**: This script contains the data cleaning process.
* **Building the networks**: In this script we demonstrate how we builded our weighted and unweighted network.
* **Feature extraction**: Extracting the features from our networks
* **Building and evaluating the GCN model**: Creating the GCN model and evaluating its peformance.
